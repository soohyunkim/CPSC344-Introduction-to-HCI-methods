## Week4: Mental Models, Human Abilities, Cognition

### Mental models & Cognitive Frameworks
- Why look at __cognition__?
    - Part of doing good design is understanding how people __reason__ and __react__ to interface experiences 
    - __cognitive frameworks__ helps us do this
        - theoretical models that provide __predictive__ and __explanatory__ power for understanding user behaviour 
        - based on theories of cognition
    - __internal frameworks__: about the mental process inside users head 
        - eg. mental model
    - __external frameworks__: account for interactions with technologies, environment, context 
Define __Mental Models__ and describe their characteristics (LG)
- Give examples of how a mental model can be acquired
- __Mental Models__
    - ppl form internal, mental models of themselves and of the things which they are interacting
    - ppl use mental models to 
        - reason about a system
        - figure out what to do when things go wrong
    - characteristics
        - incomplete
        - constantly evolving
        - not accurate representation (contains errors/ uncertainty measures)
        - provide a simple representation of a complex phenomena
        - can be represented by a set of _if-then-else_ rules
    -__mental models: something that user has (forms)__
        - users "__see__" the system through mental models
        - users __rely__ on mental models during usage
        - there are various __forms__ of mental models
        - mental models can __support__ users' interaction
    - conceptual models and conceptual design: what the __designer__ does to foster good emntal model formation by the user 
        - design concepts all inform a user's mental model 
        - eg. scissors: object that helps form a mental model
            - affordance: holes for something to be inserted 
            - constraints: big hole for several fingers, small hole for thumb 
            - mapping: holes-for-fingers suggested, constrained by appearance
            - positive transfer and cultural idioms: learnt when young, constraint mechanism 
            - mental model: physical object implies how the operating parts work
                - reasonable mental model can be formed by looking at/ holding the object
    - Acquiring mental models: done by the __user__
        - during system usage, user's own activity leads to a mental model
            - explanatory theory is developed by the user
            - often used to predict future behaviour of the system
        - observing others using the system
            - casual observation of others working
            - asking someone else to "do this for me"
            - formal training sessions
        - reading about a system
            - documentation, help screens, "for Dummies" books
    - Object that hinders mental model formation: eg. "old style" digital watch
        - mental model must be _taught_ or learned by trial/error
Explain what __Norman's 7 stage model__ is good for (LG)
- Models are often "runnable"
    - includes notion of __causality__
    - used for __explanation__: to understand why the system responded as it did, _interpretation_ in Norman's model
    - used for __prediction__: to select an appropriate action, _intention_ in Norman's model
- __Norman's seven stage model__
Use gulf/stages to analyze interactions with a system 
Gulf of execution
    ->
    1. Establish goals
        - what do I want the system to do next?
    2. Form intention to act
        - what can I do next?
        - what if I do this?
    3. Decide on sequence of actions
        - to do it, I'll do this then this.
    4. Execute the action sequence
    "the difference between the intentions and allowable actions"
    The world 
    ->
    "the difference between actual system state and user's understanding"
    Gulf of Evaluation
    ->
    5. Perceive the state of the world 
        - what will I see as a result?
    6. Interpret perceived state
        - what am I now seeing?
    7. Evaluate system w.r.t. goals
        - what did the system just do?
        - after: what did I do to make the system do that?
- Norman's seven stage model is good for...
    - internal framework: best for __exploratory learning__
    - less applicable to highly learned, semiautomatic behaviour

Be able to identify a mismatch in mental models (LG)
- __misconceptions__ happen when user's model differs in critical ways from how the system actually works 
- Give examples of situations or interfaces where mismatch occurs
    - "more is more" belief about interactions
        - high oven temp makes oven heat faster
        - pressing walk button repeatedly will make light change faster
    - folk theories and remedies for computing
        - reboot when computer "gets slow"
        - reboot computer to make projector work
- Mismatch, why does it happen?
    - sometimes, a poor model is fostered
        eg. Norman's fridge

Explain the difference between __internal and external cognitive frameworks__ (LG)
- Information processing: another way of thinking about internal cognition
    - ordered processing stages (with input/output)
    - useful for making predictions, identifying bottlenecks
    - human processor model (combines information processing with perceptual senses for input + output)
- Give examples of the types of factors or representations that could be important when analyzing distributed/external cognition
    - __External cognition__: the use of _external world_ to achieve cognition (use external representations to work with your internal representations)
        - external cognition frameworks is concerned with how _representations and factors in environment help/hinder cognition_
    - __Distributed cognition__: the idea that cognition happens _across_ individuals, artifacts, and time, is _embodied_
    - __Embodied interaction__: concerned with how someone's experience of the world and the meaning they create is shaped through physical/social interactions
- Give examples of __external representatons__ that help with memory load reduction, computational offloading and cognitive tracing 
    - Benefits of external representations
        - externeralizing info is very helpful for _remembering_
        - _computational offloading_: using tools an ddevices to carry out computations and other tasks 
            - eg. doing math problems on paper -> allows you to see the change, come back to it later, share with others
    - modification: reflecting changes or intention by modifying external representations by: annotation, cognifive tracing
        - _cognitive tracing_: manipulating objects into new orders and structures
    - Why do we use external representations?
        - often used _naturally_
        - can often be set up in very personal ways
    - Downsides to using external representations
        - ppl may start to ignore them when reminders are too frequent
