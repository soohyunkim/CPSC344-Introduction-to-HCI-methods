## Week2: Design Concepts, HCI Process, Evaluation Goals

## Design Concepts
### Learning Goals
-   Describe the __stages__ of the HCI process and different types of __goals__ each might have
-   Define and identify __stakeholders__
-   Start to develop __evaluation goals__

### Psychology of Every Day things
- Some __principles__ for good design of usability and UX
    - Common failures: absence of usability & UX
- Can use principles to __analyze__ & __critique__ interfaces
- Design better interfaces by applying them
- Need to use them __judiciously__
    - Applied blindly: will get you in trouble
- Subjective? A lot of wrong answers and only a few right ones

### UX and Usability Goals
- __goals/ value statements__ that you want to __max/minimize__
- UX
    - Usability: effectiveness, efficiency, learnability, memorability, safety, utility
    - undesirable aspects: unpleasant, frustrating, gimmicky
    - desirable aspects: exciting, fun, rewarding 

### Design concepts
- Basics: __affordance__, __visibility__, __feedback__
- Other concepts: signifiers, mapping, constraints (perceptible), transfer effects, cultural associations, individual differences 
- Conceptual and mental models 

### Affordance
- a __relationship__ between an object's __properties__ and your __abilities__
- eg1. small, cylindrical, light <--> I can grab this 
- eg2. flat, sturdy, not too high <--> I can sit on this 

### Signifier
- The __physical form__ of a sign from semiotics (study of symbols & their meaning)
- manipulate your __signifiers__ to create an __affordance__
- change the __properties__ of an object to tell ppl what they can do with it 

### Mapping
- A relationship between __signifiers__ and __functions/states__ of an interface
- things I can perceive -> actions/states
- buttons -> functions, knob twist -> volume, turn wheel -> go left
- Can be _natural_ or _arbitrary_

### Visibility
- How __perceptible__ a signifier or action is
- __Discoverability__: Can the user easily _perceive_ all of the actions that they can perform?
- __System status__: Can the users _recognize_ and _correctly interpret_ the system's state?

### Feedback
- A __signal__ from the system after an __action__ is performed
- Can the user correctly interpret the relationship between their _actions_ and the _system's actions_?

### Constraint
- A __limit__ on what we can do with a system
- eg. USB drive can only be put in _one way_ successfully

### Transfer Effect
- When __knowledge__ from one system __transfers__ to another system
- _Positive transfer effect_: I have driven a car before, so I can drive this car
- _Negative transfer effect_: All the short cuts I used to know don't work here! 

### Who are my users and what are their needs? 
- Defining systems as designers (implement structures that create culture)

#### Cultural Associations
- Different cultures associate different __meanings__ with different __signifiers__
- Eg. traffic light - red: stop, yellow: slow down, green: go
- __Culture__ does not mean nationality

#### Individual Differences
- Different ppl have different abilities, experiences, and values
- Can try to: design for the avg, specific group, personalization

## HCI Design Process
- __Stages__ of design 
- Design stages have different goals
- Evaluation tools to support those goals
- Identifying __stakeholders__ 
- Roadmap to __evaluation types__

### Why do we need a process?
- the "Double Diamond"
- PROBLEM --> Discover --> Define --> DEFINITION --> Develop --> Deliver --> SOLUTION
- Discover/Define:  Research analyze, synthesize
- Develop/Deliver: Prototype, test, refine 
- Human activity needing better support --> _usable_ and _useful_ interactive system that addresses this 

### Process stages and their goals (LG)
- __pre__ design: understand the problem 
    - do users really have the problem you think they do?
    - who are the users? non-users involved in the problem & potential solution? who cares?
    - what are your users like and how varied are they?
    - what is the task?
    - what properties must a solution have?
- __early__ design: explore design space
    - considered relevant approaches?
    - 'metrics' you should be considering as you compare approaches?
    - high-risk elements of your likely approach, can you address them?
- __mid__ design: develop the chosen approach; reduce risk
    - major 'elements' of your design that can be advanced separately?
    - major questions/uncertainties/risks associated with each design element?
    - user input needed to verify your design progress?
    - prototypes do you need to support problem solving? 
- __late__ design: integrate and start to deploy
    - integrate different design elements
    - final delivery platform
    - put systems in real users' hands in real contexts for longer durations
    - fine-tune, debug
- __always__ evaluate and prototype
- interviews, observation, questionnaires: valuable throughout design process but may be executed differently
    - _early_: interview/observe for understanding
    - _later_: input on your design approach and details

### Look at USER INTERFACE DESIGN PROCESS: EVOLVING ITERATIONS graph
- Key features: 
    - __iteration__: both within and between stages
        - KEY: because it is hard to predict or perfectly model
        - ppl: diversity in abilities, needs, motivations...
    - stage evolution: in goals and methods
        - role of evaluation in stages: must connect our design progress to user's and task needs and contexts
        - _evaluation techniques_: tools in a toolkit 
        - know your tools and choose effectively
    - methods: used throughout, or stage-specific

### Stakeholders (LG)
- __Stakeholder__: anyone who has some reason to care about the interface
    - lots of them, needs may conflict
- _user_: convenience, functionality, etc
- _boss_: price, worker efficiency
- _developer_: ease of development - deadlines/budget
- _manufacturer_: cost of production
- _advertiser_: visibility
- How to figure out who your stakeholders are?
    - who will use it, ask for it, decide whether to use it, pay for it, make design/build it, make profit from it, needs it (or else will make your life miserable if they don't like it), can't/won't use it?

### Evaluation goals (LG)
- Human activity: must be __interface-independent__, __high-level__, __simple__
    - VS. task: __interface-dependent__, __low-level__
- Eg. Human activity: cleaning your teeth/ task: brushing your teeth manually, sub-tasks: wet toothbrush, apply toothpaste
- Need to understand the problem at hand, __evaluate the system__ as it is used currently by real ppl
- After brainstorming questions, start to _group_ the _questions_ together,_refine_ your ideas, ask _higher level_ questions, fill in any _missing spots_
- GOOD EVALUATION GOALS: 
    - succinct, measurable, specific (but not TOO low-level), clear
    - clearly state what the _goal_ of the evaluation is
    - _iteration_, _thought_, and _care_
