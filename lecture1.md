## Week1: How Interfaces Fail?

### Learning goals
- Understand the world in terms of choices that designers have made
    - Designers need to negotiate _competing values_, _constraints_, _functional requirements_ of the choices
- Relationship between the myth of _human error_ and goal of human computer interaction
    - Human centered design as a philosophy:
        - Try to understand the problem as best as possible
        - Make decisions based on data
        - Justify your design choices
        - Prototype
        - Iterate
    - Place human experience at the centre of your design decisions
        - Feelings, how bodies work, things used, limitations
    - _Myth of human error_:
        - Most failures of human-machine system are due to poor designs that don’t recognize people’s capabilities and fallibilities
        - Leads to apparent machine misuse and “human error”
            - Actually errors in design that needs to be taken account as a designer!
        - Good design accounts for _human limitations_
            - Eg1. tractor example: “driver’s error”
            - Eg2. WWII: booster fails, altimeter gauges reading human factors are a big deal here
        - Some _principles_ for good design of usability and UX
            - Common failures: absence of usability & UX
        - Can use principles to _analyze_ & _critique_ interfaces
        - Design better interfaces by applying them
        - Need to use them _judiciously_
            - Applied blindly: will get you in trouble
        - Subjective? A lotn of wrong answers and only a few right ones
-   List _concepts/heuristics/principles_ for good/bad interface design
    - A few way interfaces can fail
        - Functionality problem: function the object performs
        - System status visibility problem: mode of object
        - Control visibility problem: control/sequence of controls
        - Feedback problem
    - Designers go wrong when… they do not start with basic needs
        - Understand the range of users and their physiological limitations
        - Communicate what it does
        - Provide a model (i.e. apparent to the user) of how something works
        - Provide feedback
        - Foresee possible contexts of use
-   Be able to identify and critique interface strengths and weaknesses in terms of this language
    - What makes interface design hard?
        - _Interaction is unpredictable and complex_
            - Cooperative (complicated coordination)
            - Users change their minds & get distracted
            - They use in unforeseen ways (then evolve that use)
        - _Tasks are implicit and complex  (poorly defined)_
            - Machine often doesn’t “know” the user’s goal
            -   Distribution of tasks between human & machine is a moving target
- User task is getting more complex
    - Number of things to control are increasing
    - Display is artificial
        - Red lights in car: problems VS Flames: fire
    - Feedback is more complex, subtle, and less natural
    - Errors are increasingly serious and/or costly
- Market place pressures
    - Adding functionality (complexity) is easy & cheap
    - Adding controls/feedback is expensive + takes up space
    - Designer time is expensive
    - Consumers value cost/ looks over usability
-   Explain the difference between technology-centred VS human-centered design
    - _Technology-centred design_
        - Design decisions guided by technology (tech advances make progress)
        -  Prevalent attitude in real world – looks cool, engaging, fun
            -   Goal: show off gadgets + inventions
        - Problem: risk of leaving out real ppl with real problems right now
    - _Human-centered design_
        - Progress made by incorporating ppl into the process
        - Empirical studies integrated early into the design + users as part of the dev team
