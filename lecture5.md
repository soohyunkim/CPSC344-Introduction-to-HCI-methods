### Types of Data
- Subjective
    - Data about a subject's perspective, experiences, feelings, beliefs and desires
    - Personal (someone's opinion)
- Objective
    - Data that is _not_ influenced by emotions, opinions, or personal feelings
    - Based in _fact_, objective data is measurable, and can be verified
- Qualitative
    - Data that is _not_ expressed in numerical terms.
    - Includes descriptions, quotes, images, and stories
- Quantitative
    - Data that is in the form of numbers.
    - Measure of sth - number, size, etc

### Types of data that evaluation methods provide
- Spectrum of data: 
    - Subjective: user tells you how frustrating a task is 
    - Qualitative: users tell you of problems & situations of which they are aware
    - Quantitative: measure task performance using time to compelte, errors, dead ends, learning curves for novices

### Qualitative -> Quantitative
- eg. How many steps each user did 


### Analyzing and Interpreting data
- Where to start
1) Begin with initial reactions or observations from the data (eg. patterns, simple calculations)
2) 
- Qualitative data: interpreted to tell a "story"
    - categories, themees, patterns, etc
    - eg. they all show up in the same category, number of steps (patterns) that showed up when they were picking a theme
- Quantitative data: presented as values, tables, charts, and graphs
    - counts (eg. summary of total # of errors)
    - simple statistical analysis (eg. averages)
    - advanced statistical analysis (eg. linear regression)
Choice of analysis: depend on _type_ of data that you have && what you are using it for 

### Simple methods for qualitative analysis
- categorizing (coding) data
- critical incident analysis
- finding patterns and themes 
    - tool: affinity diagrams
- In all cases, the aim is to interpret the data in ways that _encapsulate_ and _document_ your understanding
- Many methods often used in combination

### Qualitative analysis methods - categorizing(coding data)
- Typically used on transcripts (meetings, interviews, etc)
    - _non-granular_ level of detail to find stories or themes
    - at _fine levels_ of detail focusing on words, sentences, gestures, etc
- First data is 'coded' according to a scheme of categories
    - can be _predetermined_ or _arise naturally_ from the data

### Critical incident analysis
- Identify and focus on the most significant incidents
    - efficient when you have lots of data
    - incidents can be either desirable or undesirable
- Not about summarizing all incidents that occur
    - more like finding tiny gold nuggets in buckets of sand
    - in a bucket of data, incidents come in... but the rest are non-relevant data
- Analyze in detail and report on incidents
    - Often using combinations of other analysis techniques
        - eg. themes and patterns between incidents
        - eg. categorizing
