## Week5: Types of Data & Data Analysis Techniques

## PART1: Types of Data

### Types of Data
- Subjective
    - Data about a subject's perspective, experiences, feelings, beliefs and desires
    - Personal (someone's opinion)
- Objective
    - Data that is _not_ influenced by emotions, opinions, or personal feelings
    - Based in _fact_, objective data is _measurable_, and can be verified
- Qualitative
    - Data that is _not_ expressed in numerical terms.
    - Includes descriptions, quotes, images, and stories
- Quantitative
    - Data that is in the form of numbers.
    - Measure of sth - number, size, etc

### Types of data that evaluation methods provide
- Spectrum of data: 
    - Subjective: 
        - user tells you how frustrating a task is
        - you observe users and note they appear to enjoy the app they were using 
    - Objective:
        - measure _task performance_ using time to complete, errors, dead ends, learning curves for novices
        - _numerical data_ from user-reported answers (eg. # of books read per year)
        - users tell you what city they were born in 
    - Qualitative: 
        - users tell you of problems & situations of which they are aware
        - you _observe_ situations that users may not fully be aware of
    - Quantitative: 
        - measure task performance using time to complete, errors, dead ends, learning curves for novices
        - _numerical data_ from user reported answers (eg. number of emails/day)
        - counting observed occurrences (eg. number of times looked at instructions)

### Transforming the Data
Qualitative -> Quantitative
- eg. How many steps each user did 

## PART2: What to _do_ with all that data: _data analysis_ techniques

### Analyzing and Interpreting data
- Where to start
1) Begin with initial reactions or observations from the data (eg. patterns, simple calculations)
2) More detailed analysis using structured frameworks/theories
- __Qualitative data__: interpreted to tell a "story"
    - categories, themes, patterns, etc
    - eg. they all show up in the same category, number of steps (patterns) that showed up when they were picking a theme
- __Quantitative data__: presented as values, tables, charts, and graphs
    - counts (eg. summary of total # of errors)
    - simple statistical analysis (eg. averages)
    - advanced statistical analysis (eg. linear regression)
Choice of analysis: depend on _type_ of data that you have && what you are using it for 

### Simple methods for qualitative analysis
- categorizing (coding) data
    - results (quantitative or qualitative) then analyzed using appropriate methods
    - avg # of problems mentioned per participant, themes/patterns of behavour, recurring problems
- critical incident analysis
    - identify and focus on the _most significant_ incidents
        - efficient when you have lots of data
        - incidents can be either desirable or undesirable
        - NOT about summarizing all incidents that occur
    - then analyzie in detail and report on incidents (use combination of other analysis techniques)
- finding patterns and themes 
    - tool: __affinity diagrams__
        - used to organize and consolidate specific insights from collected data or ideas
        - common technique to find recurring patterns/themes
        - can be used for many purposes (including analysis)
        - record each idea/observation/problem on an individual card or notes -> group the related notes together until all used (sort & resort into larger clusters subgroups as necessary)
        - let groups emerge, rather than start with pre-defined groups
    - can emerge in many ways: process of conducting the study, using tool sand techniques
    - can support many types of evaluation goals (eg. behaviour, culture, palces or situations where events occur, breakdowns, user characteristics, etc)
    - very _flexible_ and _widely used_ (can be reported as findings or inform more analysis, also applicable to quantitative data)
- In all cases, the aim is to interpret the data in ways that _encapsulate_ and _document_ your understanding
- Many methods often used in combination

### Qualitative analysis methods - categorizing(coding data)
- Typically used on transcripts (meetings, interviews, etc)
    - _non-granular_ level of detail to find _stories or themes_
    - at _fine levels_ of detail focusing on _words, sentences, gestures, etc_
- First data is 'coded' according to a scheme of categories
    - can be _predetermined_ or _arise naturally_ from the data

### Simple techniques for quantitative analysis
- averages (mean, mode, median)
- range, max, min
- percentages
- charts & graphs

### How far do you take analysis?
- As far as it is helpful for your needs
    - most _important activities/tasks_ to support
    - key _issues_ and areas that need _improvement_
    - things that _work well_ and should be retained
    - where _task dependencies_ occur
    - what is _essential VS non-essential_ in an implementation
- Requirements begin to emerge here!
