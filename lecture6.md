Task Examples
- probably going to be asked to write one on the midterm

Good task examples
-
- 
- describe a complete job 
- say who the users are
    - Design success strongly influenced by what users know
    - Use real-ish names
- as a set, identify a braod coverage of users and task types
    - typical "expected" user: typical routine tasks
    - occasional but important user: infrequent but important tasks
    - the unusual user: unexpected or odd tasks
- Are evaluated (final and very important step)
    - circulate descriptions to users, and rewrite if needed
        - ask users for (omissions, corrections, _, _ )

Grocery List Task Example (written down)


Requirements and Metrics
-
- Can requirements change?
    - requirements should be _stable_ (if based on good data)
    - but not _rigid_
        - they may shift overtime (as design reality dictates what is possible/feasible given other constraints)
